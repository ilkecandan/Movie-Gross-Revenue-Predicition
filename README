This is a development of a machine learning model that predicts gross revenue of a movie.
We have a data from cinema industry. After checking how are values correlate with each other, to create the most 
correct model; we will use various values. 

After, data cleaning I have tried various machine learning models such as LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor 
and RandomForestRegressor. We contunied with Decision Tree Regressor since it showed an error value of 0. 

This model can be used before producing a movie. So we already need to have values of our year, budget, director, writer
and star.
